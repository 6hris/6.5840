Part 1: Key/value server with reliable network

1. Implement put and get RPC handlers in server.go
    - server should have an in memory map of type <string, (string, Tversion)> 
      to pair the key with its value and version number 
2. Add RPC-sending code to the put/get methods in client.go

Part 2: Implementing a lock using key/value clerk

The purpose of this part is to have a lock mechanism that is shared and works between different programs
we will want to track who owns what lock

<key, <value, version>>

<lock_id, <client_id, version>>
